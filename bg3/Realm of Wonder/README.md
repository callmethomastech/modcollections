# Description
This is meant to be a super easy to use and easy to install Mod Collection that I personally use and update. You are more than welcome to remix this pack as your own the mod order list and some detailed information is available at this pastebin link if you are interested in checking it out or if your current load order gets corrupted or out of order. Please note that this pastebin load order is only available for the latest release at the moment may change to a GitHub link for saving past load orders.
#### Load Order: [https://github.com/callmethomastech/modcollections/tree/main/bg3/Realm%20of%20Wonder/Load%20Orders](https://github.com/callmethomastech/modcollections/tree/main/bg3/Realm%20of%20Wonder/Load%20Orders)

## Before you start
### Recommendations
- With all the encounters mods it is recommended to play in Balanced as they add over leveled encounters that make the game feel more naturally difficult rather than artificially so.
### Requirements
- Make sure the load order file is loaded correctly
- Have Fun
### Questions
 - Leave a comment or bug and I will get to it as soon as possible.
